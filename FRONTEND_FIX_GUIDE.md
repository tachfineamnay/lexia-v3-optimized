# üö® Frontend Display Issue - RESOLVED

## Problem Description
The application at `app.ialexia.fr` and `localhost:8083` was showing the Vite development server's source explorer instead of the built React application.

## Root Causes Identified

### 1. üîß **Port Mapping Issue**
- **Problem**: `docker-compose.yml` was mapping frontend to port `3000:80` instead of `8083:80`
- **Solution**: Fixed port mapping to match expected local port 8083

### 2. üèóÔ∏è **Build Configuration**
- **Problem**: The Dockerfile wasn't properly handling the production build process
- **Solution**: Enhanced multi-stage build with proper dependency installation and build optimization

### 3. üåê **NGINX Configuration**
- **Problem**: NGINX wasn't serving the built static files correctly
- **Solution**: Enhanced nginx.conf with better SPA routing and error handling

### 4. üì¶ **Coolify Configuration Mismatch**
- **Problem**: Coolify port configuration didn't match docker-compose
- **Solution**: Updated coolify.json to use port 8083

## Applied Fixes

### ‚úÖ Files Modified:

1. **`docker-compose.yml`**
   - Changed frontend port mapping from `3000:80` to `8083:80`

2. **`Dockerfile.frontend`**
   - Enhanced multi-stage build process
   - Added proper npm dependency installation
   - Improved production optimizations

3. **`frontend/nginx.conf`**
   - Enhanced SPA routing with proper fallback
   - Added security headers
   - Improved error handling and logging
   - Better cache control for static assets

4. **`coolify.json`**
   - Updated frontend port from 3000 to 8083

### ‚úÖ New Files Created:

1. **`fix-frontend-deployment.sh`**
   - Automated deployment fix script
   - Includes health checks and validation

2. **`FRONTEND_FIX_GUIDE.md`** (this file)
   - Comprehensive troubleshooting documentation

## Deployment Instructions

### For Local Testing:
```bash
# 1. Run the automated fix script
chmod +x fix-frontend-deployment.sh
./fix-frontend-deployment.sh

# 2. Manual steps if needed
docker-compose down
docker-compose build --no-cache frontend
docker-compose up -d

# 3. Verify the fix
curl http://localhost:8083/health.txt
curl -I http://localhost:8083/
```

### For Coolify Deployment:

1. **Push Changes to Repository**
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Fix: Frontend deployment serving development server instead of production build"
   git push origin main
   ```

2. **Update Coolify Configuration**
   - Verify the frontend service is configured for port 8083
   - Ensure `VITE_API_URL` environment variable points to the correct backend URL
   - Example: `VITE_API_URL=https://api.ialexia.fr` or your backend domain

3. **Trigger Deployment**
   - Go to Coolify dashboard
   - Navigate to your LexiaV3 project
   - Click "Deploy" to trigger a fresh deployment
   - Monitor the build logs for any errors

4. **Verification Steps**
   - Check `https://app.ialexia.fr/health.txt` returns "healthy"
   - Verify `https://app.ialexia.fr` shows the actual React application
   - Test navigation to ensure SPA routing works
   - Check browser DevTools for any console errors

## Expected Results

After applying these fixes:

‚úÖ **`https://app.ialexia.fr`** should show the proper LexiaV3 landing page
‚úÖ **`localhost:8083`** should serve the production React build
‚úÖ **Navigation** should work properly with client-side routing
‚úÖ **Static assets** should load with proper caching headers
‚úÖ **Health checks** should pass consistently

## Troubleshooting

If issues persist after deployment:

### 1. Check Build Logs
- Verify the frontend build completes successfully
- Look for any Vite build errors or warnings

### 2. Verify Environment Variables
- Ensure `VITE_API_URL` is set correctly in Coolify
- Check that `NODE_ENV=production` is set

### 3. Container Inspection
```bash
# Check if the correct files are in the container
docker exec -it lexia-frontend ls -la /usr/share/nginx/html/

# Check NGINX is serving the right content
docker exec -it lexia-frontend cat /etc/nginx/conf.d/default.conf
```

### 4. Browser Cache
- Clear browser cache (Ctrl+F5 or Cmd+Shift+R)
- Try accessing in incognito/private mode

### 5. DNS/CDN Issues
- Verify DNS is pointing to the correct Coolify instance
- Check if there's any CDN caching (Cloudflare, etc.)

## Prevention

To prevent this issue in the future:

1. **Always use production builds** for deployment
2. **Test locally** before deploying with the same Docker configuration
3. **Monitor health checks** to catch deployment issues early
4. **Use proper port mapping** consistent across environments
5. **Regular deployment testing** with the provided scripts

## Support

If you continue to experience issues:

1. Run the diagnostic script: `./fix-frontend-deployment.sh`
2. Check the container logs: `docker-compose logs frontend`
3. Verify the build process: `docker-compose build --no-cache frontend`
4. Contact support with the specific error messages and logs
